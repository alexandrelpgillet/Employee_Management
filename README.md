Employee Management

-Description:

Develop a system in C language to manage information about a company's employees. The system must be capable of storing employee data, such as name, surname, position, salary and department, using structures (structs) to represent employee records. Furthermore, the system must allow basic transactions to be carried out, such as adding, listing, searching, updating and deleting employees.

-Features to be renewed:

1)Add Employee: Allow the user to enter the data of a new employee, such as name, surname, position, salary and department. The data must be stored in a binary file.

2)List Employees: Display a list of all registered employees on the screen, showing the main data of each one.

3)Search Employee: Allow the user to search for an employee by their first or last name and display on the screen all information related to that employee, if found.

4)Update Employee: Allows the user to update information about an existing employee, such as their position, salary or department.

5)Delete Employee: Allows the user to delete an employee from the system, removing their data from the file.

6)Additional requirements:

Use pointers to manipulate employee records and to perform read and write operations on files.
Implement specific functions for each of the system's functionalities, following a modular approach.

Use file manipulation to store employee data persistently between different program runs.
Implement a simple and intuitive user interface to interact with the system, using clear messages and instructions to guide the user during use of the program.
